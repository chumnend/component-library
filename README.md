# @chumnend/component-library

## About this library
This is personal react component library built by me to be used in various projects. This library itself
will grow over time and be updated based on the components that I want to make use of. The library is written 
in Typescript and makes use of tools like `Rollup` and `Storybook` to help me develop the library.

### Built With
- Typescript
- Rollup
- Storybook

## Getting Started
1) Install dependencies with your package manager of choice. For this project I made use of Yarn

```
yarn
```

2) Open Storybook to view components

```
yarn start
```

3) Run tests for validation

```
yarn test
```

4) Code can be auto-formatted by running the lint command

```

```

5) Build the project
